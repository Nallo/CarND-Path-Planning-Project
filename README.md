# CarND-Path-Planning-Project
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

## Reflection

The path planner implementation is done entirely in the `main.cpp` file for ease
of reading. The code to generate the best path according to the *virtual* environment
is divided in two macro sections. The former section, **Behavior**, determines
the other cars' positions relative to the ego car and take actions regarding
staying/changing lane. The latter section, **trajectory generation**, compute the best
path according to the output generated from the prediction phase.

Following, the two macro sections are described in depth.

**Behavior: Lines 260 - 339**
The prediction phase makes heavy use of the sensor fusion data stored in the
`sensor_fusion` array. In particular, the planner exploits the `s` and `d` values
in the [Frenet coordinate system](https://www.classe.cornell.edu/~hoff/LECTURES/10USPAS/notes04.pdf)
of the other cars to determine whether there is
a car:
  - in front
  - to the right
  - to the left

of the ego car.

In particular, the model raises the flag `car_left`/`car_right` if there is a car
to the left / right of the ego car within 30 meters (lines 300 - 309). Once the
flags are set, the model decides what to do.

If there is a car in front of the ego car, we have three options:
  - go to the left lane
  - go to the right lane
  - stay in the same lane and breaking

In case no cars are detected in front of the ego car, the model simply decides to
accelerate smoothly until it reaches the max speed allowed (set to 49.5 mph for
safety reasons).

**Trajectory Generation: Lines 341 - 445**
In order to determine the best trajectory for the car, the model exploits the speed,
the lane output from the behavior phase and car coordinates and past path points.

Firstly, the new trajectory is generated starting from the last two points of the
previous trajectory. In case the previous trajectory is not available, we take
into account the car's position. Secondly we setup three target points respectively
30, 60 and 90 meters ahead of the car. These three points helps us generating
a smooth trajectory using the spline library. To make the work easier
for the spline calculation, the coordinates are transformed (shift and rotation)
to local car coordinates (lines 393 and 394).

It is worth noting how the trajectory generation takes into consideration the
target speed of the car adjusted in the behavior phase. Finally, a smooth
trajectory is achieved by pushing to the new trajectory, part of the previous
trajectory's points. The remaining point (50 in total) are generated by the spline.

It was extremely useful using the spline to generate new trajectories because the
math can easily draw smooth lines when the car is turning or changing lane.

### Simulator.
You can download the Term3 Simulator which contains the Path Planning Project from the [releases tab (https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases).

### Goals
In this project your goal is to safely navigate around a virtual highway with other traffic that is driving +-10 MPH of the 50 MPH speed limit. You will be provided the car's localization and sensor fusion data, there is also a sparse map list of waypoints around the highway. The car should try to go as close as possible to the 50 MPH speed limit, which means passing slower traffic when possible, note that other cars will try to change lanes too. The car should avoid hitting other cars at all cost as well as driving inside of the marked road lanes at all times, unless going from one lane to another. The car should be able to make one complete loop around the 6946m highway. Since the car is trying to go 50 MPH, it should take a little over 5 minutes to complete 1 loop. Also the car should not experience total acceleration over 10 m/s^2 and jerk that is greater than 10 m/s^3.

#### The map of the highway is in data/highway_map.txt
Each waypoint in the list contains  [x,y,s,dx,dy] values. x and y are the waypoint's map coordinate position, the s value is the distance along the road to get to that waypoint in meters, the dx and dy values define the unit normal vector pointing outward of the highway loop.

The highway's waypoints loop around so the frenet s value, distance along the road, goes from 0 to 6945.554.

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./path_planning`.

Here is the data provided from the Simulator to the C++ Program

#### Main car's localization Data (No Noise)

["x"] The car's x position in map coordinates

["y"] The car's y position in map coordinates

["s"] The car's s position in frenet coordinates

["d"] The car's d position in frenet coordinates

["yaw"] The car's yaw angle in the map

["speed"] The car's speed in MPH

#### Previous path data given to the Planner

//Note: Return the previous list but with processed points removed, can be a nice tool to show how far along
the path has processed since last time.

["previous_path_x"] The previous list of x points previously given to the simulator

["previous_path_y"] The previous list of y points previously given to the simulator

#### Previous path's end s and d values

["end_path_s"] The previous list's last point's frenet s value

["end_path_d"] The previous list's last point's frenet d value

#### Sensor Fusion Data, a list of all other car's attributes on the same side of the road. (No Noise)

["sensor_fusion"] A 2d vector of cars and then that car's [car's unique ID, car's x position in map coordinates, car's y position in map coordinates, car's x velocity in m/s, car's y velocity in m/s, car's s position in frenet coordinates, car's d position in frenet coordinates.

## Details

1. The car uses a perfect controller and will visit every (x,y) point it recieves in the list every .02 seconds. The units for the (x,y) points are in meters and the spacing of the points determines the speed of the car. The vector going from a point to the next point in the list dictates the angle of the car. Acceleration both in the tangential and normal directions is measured along with the jerk, the rate of change of total Acceleration. The (x,y) point paths that the planner recieves should not have a total acceleration that goes over 10 m/s^2, also the jerk should not go over 50 m/s^3. (NOTE: As this is BETA, these requirements might change. Also currently jerk is over a .02 second interval, it would probably be better to average total acceleration over 1 second and measure jerk from that.

2. There will be some latency between the simulator running and the path planner returning a path, with optimized code usually its not very long maybe just 1-3 time steps. During this delay the simulator will continue using points that it was last given, because of this its a good idea to store the last points you have used so you can have a smooth transition. previous_path_x, and previous_path_y can be helpful for this transition since they show the last points given to the simulator controller with the processed points already removed. You would either return a path that extends this previous path or make sure to create a new path that has a smooth transition with this last path.

## Tips

A really helpful resource for doing this project and creating smooth trajectories was using http://kluge.in-chemnitz.de/opensource/spline/, the spline function is in a single hearder file is really easy to use.

keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!


## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
